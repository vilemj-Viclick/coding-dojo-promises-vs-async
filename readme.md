##### Seriously... Read this file...

## What is this?
This is supporting code for a coding dojo on the subject of promises and the parallel with async/await.
## How to start?
1. Install node. ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
	- Set the PATH variable so that `npm` and `node` commands work.
	- All was developed with node@8.4.0 and npm@5.3.0. All will certainly work with these versions, however the author is not aware of any issues that should transpire with any earlier versions.
1. Clone the repository (obviously...)
	- Or download the repo as a ZIP and extract it.
1. Open your favorite command-line in the repository
1. Run these commands: 
	```
	npm install --no-optional
	npm install typescript@2.6.1 -g --no-optional
	npm install ts-node@3.3.0 -g --no-optional
	```
1. Run the first exercise like this
	```
	ts-node ex1.ts
	```
1. You'll get it from here... If not, this is not for you.
